# MuWire - Easy Anonymous File-Sharing

MuWire is an easy to use file-sharing program which offers anonymity using [I2P technology](http://geti2p.net).  It works on any platform Java works on, including Windows,MacOS,Linux.

It is inspired by the LimeWire Gnutella client and developped by a former LimeWire developer.

The current stable release - 0.4.0 is avaiable for download at https://muwire.com.  You can find technical documentation in the "doc" folder.

### Building

You need JRE 8 or newer.  After installing that and setting up the appropriate paths, just type

```
./gradlew clean assemble 
```

If you want to run the unit tests, type
```
./gradlew clean build
```

Some of the UI tests will fail because they haven't been written yet :-/

### Running

You need to have an I2P router up and running on the same machine.  After you build the application, look inside `gui/build/distributions`.  Untar/unzip one of the `shadow` files and then run the jar contained inside by typing `java -jar MuWire-x.y.z.jar` in a terminal or command prompt.  If you use a custom I2CP host and port, create a file `$HOME/.MuWire/i2p.properties` and put `i2cp.tcp.host=<host>` and `i2cp.tcp.port=<port>` in there.

The first time you run MuWire it will ask you to select a nickname.  This nickname will be displayed with search results, so that others can verify the file was shared by you.  It is best to leave MuWire running all the time, just like I2P.
