# TODO List

### Network

##### Bloom Filters

This reduces query traffic by not sending last hop queries to peers that definitely do not have the file

##### Two-tier Topology

This helps with scalability

### Core

* Metadata parsing and search
* Automatic adjustment of number of I2P tunnels
* Persist trust immediately
* Check if user-selected download and incomplete locations exist and are writeable
* Enum i18n
* Ability to share trust list only with trusted users
* Confidential files visible only to certain users
* Public Feed feature

### Chat
* echo "unknown/innappropriate command" in the console
* break up lines on CR/LF, send multiple messages
* Style timestamps and persona names
* enforce # in room names or ignore it
* auto-create/join channel on server start
* jump from notification window to room with message

### Swing GUI
* I2P Status panel - display message when connected to external router
* Search box - left identation

### Web UI/Plugin
* HTML 5 media players
* Minimal dependency (break up groovy-all.jar)
* Remove versions from jar names
* Security: POST nonces, CSP headers
